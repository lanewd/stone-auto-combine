# opencv-template-matching-growstone
Template match stones and combine them automatically in GrowStone.

<p>growstonetemplatematcher.py is the main file. It loops through and reads the images of stones here in the same directory.</p>
<p>matchtester.py is just a file that I used to test matching individual stones - feel free to ignore it.</p>
